Frank Lin: hello
plz help i'm stuck on how to cleverly insert explanations
into what exActly a core is
while eve and sam are waiting outside the gate
i'm trying to set it up so that eve is trying to make sam feel self-important
to get her out of her bad mood
Will Chen: well I think how they approach a core should be important 
Frank Lin: and to do that she asks sam what a core is and why they matter
Will Chen: like during the whole forest thing sam should be more lax
Frank Lin: oh ya
part 2
Will Chen: but immediately as they start to get close a good way to show that it could be hazzardous
is to have sam start tensing up
Frank Lin: completely through the serious tone out the window
lmao
Will Chen: and basically being a little more restrictive on eve
Frank Lin: whenever i actually just blindly write i find that everything usually just becomes insanely absurd
without an ounce of seriousness
Will Chen: another thing I just thought of is that the pole that sam uses
Frank Lin: :(
Will Chen: instead of explaining the whole buzzer thing
she could basically tell eve to get away from it
pull out the pole
but describe the pole looking very damaged
Frank Lin: oh i want the buzzer description
Will Chen: from a variety of various things
Frank Lin: i think it's important for readers to know
how absurd the world is
at this point
Will Chen: so it implies that this is her buzzer clicker
and what buzzers have done before 
Frank Lin: oh
Will Chen: again just an idea
Frank Lin: hm
well
Will Chen: but these type of descriptive implications are good imo
Frank Lin: i think the short paragraph about booby-trapped doors
is there to explain
ya everything's gone to shit
Will Chen: instead of a history explaination
Frank Lin: explicitly
Will Chen: you can have
sam mentally go through
how many things could go wrong
when eve starts tapping the intercom
Frank Lin: i c
Will Chen: this can then be used
to explain like
Frank Lin: well
Will Chen: what some other cores before
have had at the start etc
that's just one idea of course
Frank Lin: i guess
in this case tho
i actually wanted to tell
not show
it was a design choice
hm although tbh most cores actually don't have a front door
since usually it's an entire city
avalaon is a special case
because it's specifically a single seaside resort
which was initially just an AI shrine
Will Chen: well seaside resorts can still be pretty large
Frank Lin: well it was a shrine forced into a resort
is how the backstory is going
basically it wasn't meant to be a city
that's why there's a gate in the first place
i guess
hm
ok i think if i combine the two
by having sam tell eve she's stupid or smthing
and then go into the backstory about doors
Will Chen: it would probably be more reasonable for sam to like
restrict eve
Frank Lin: like
put her
Will Chen: now that they're actually at the doorstep
Frank Lin: into a chokehold?
Will Chen: no like just pull her by the collar or something
idk
Frank Lin: ok
i locked eve into a chokehold
and dragged her away
i like the sound of that
although this could be 
considered abuse or smthing
at thata point
Will Chen: maybe chokehold
is a little rough
Frank Lin: lol
just shows
how close they are
Will Chen: but you know how parents like drag children away
stuff like that
Frank Lin: yes
basically
i think
the more over the top it is tho
the more entertaining it is
considering for this core
it's basically gonna be a clusterfuck in the end anyway
i changed this core to be absurd because i realized
that my vision for having a retarded twitch chat
really didn't fit into any serious setting
so while a chokehold is pretty rough it is definitely an overreaction
which kinda fits into the overall theme
Will Chen: you know might as well have sam like
made a makeshift
toddler leash
at this point
Frank Lin: looool
Will Chen: I mean it makes sense
Frank Lin: well absurd doesn't mean degrading
but that is also
definitely a valid
Will Chen: chokehold are still pretty harsh
imo
Frank Lin: overreactionj
well
its temporary
a leash means she's walking eve for extended periods of time
Will Chen: todler leashes are also temporary and save todler lives
Frank Lin: that is true
gah
Will Chen: like if pushing a damn button
Frank Lin: idk if i wanna turn eve into a toddler
Will Chen: could kill her
and she's clearly trying to push all of them
Frank Lin: looool
actualaly tho
Will Chen: I think there's some reasonable leeway there
Frank Lin: i think i said somewhere
how Eve is pretty dumb
but surprisingly smart
in very limited areas
that don't really matter
kind of like an encyclopedia
Will Chen: encyclopedias are useful in all areas
Frank Lin: hm
maybe not an encyclopedia
Will Chen: you need a wikipedia core btw
it has to happen
Frank Lin: oh yes
definitely
a wikipedia core
ok i first
need to explain
WHAT a core is
that's for the second part
Avalon Interior
while they're waiting
i need to set up a situation
where Eve gets Sam to start monologuing
about the societal structure of the new world
i tried to set it up as Eve making Sam feel better by making her feel self-important
Will Chen: well I think you should sprinkle it in
rather than a monologue
Frank Lin: true
and then i end it
Will Chen: so like first earlier on you can probably show how the place is old
Frank Lin: with Sam getting distracted and start talking about a bird
Will Chen: then like
Frank Lin: and then Eve is like that's not the right species
Will Chen: explain how places like these tend to be trapped
why they're there because it has potential usefulness
and then the rest of the history stuff could actually be like
quite conveniently conveyed in the actual avalon its self
since its old historical records
Frank Lin: yea
i was thinking of revealing it
in a private chat
with the founder of the core
actually
that was one of the original ideas
i had written down
but then i thought wait
if she could talk to someone
who was alive b4 the cataclysm
it could take out a little bit of the mystery
but then at this point since the history itself is super absurd
Will Chen: but the whole point of the thing is like
Frank Lin: i don't think i need to worry about that now
ya it's supposed to be an archive
Will Chen: the core is like supposed to contain records of the past through old human ai stuff
Frank Lin: of human consciousness
exactly
Will Chen: so why shouldn't it reveal information
a good way to "balance" the info
is that important individuals are much harder to locate in avalon
with the exception of the avalon creator himself
Frank Lin: also don't forget
Will Chen: and then sam has to piece old history from the masses of random people
Frank Lin: yes
also
i realized that 
if they have perffect AI
they could literally 
put them in robots
and have them roam around the facility
so the guy in the speakerphone
is actually one of the said AIs
that manage the facility
outside of the servers
Will Chen: you should put them in like
mini penguin robots
Frank Lin: penguins?
Will Chen: it was a safety measure just incase they turned violent
Frank Lin: oh they already did
Will Chen: penguins can't really hurt people
Frank Lin: i made a note at the bottom
Will Chen: and they look cute
Frank Lin: about the singularity
oh
i deleted it
but the "singularity" where AI become selfaware and realize they don't need their human overlords has already happened
but since they're modeled off humans and they also inherited their vices
they figured it was too much work to kill everyone
Will Chen: then what's preventing the robots from expanding the facility
Frank Lin: basically
they're too lazy
and most of them just ended up doing nothing
Will Chen: I'm pretty sure that's not how things would turn out
Frank Lin: like "what's the point in murder if at the end of the day we're still here in robot suits"
Will Chen: with that many ai's in there
they could build themselves better bodies
Frank Lin: oh ya that's why the speaker guy is actually the only AI
Will Chen: larger facilities
etc
Frank Lin: who was given a body
he's kind of like the prototype
and he was the "singularity"
after that i don't think they ever tried again
because they up and went and turned it into a resort
for cashflow
Will Chen: so who's the guy in the robot then
Frank Lin: ya
i haven't decided on 
an extremely cynical historical figure
at this point
but it should be someone who thinks everything is just futile
so definitely something like an artist
Will Chen: is this just your remake of that robot
Frank Lin: from the 18th century or smthing
could do
Will Chen: from hitchhikers
Frank Lin: no
i envisioned it
b4
Will Chen: cynical sad robot
Frank Lin: because i like cynical characters
it was originally
Will Chen: hmm
Frank Lin: gonna be the sole founder
in the chat logs
but then i moved him outside
because i liked the concept of a singularity
that just happens
but then passes
basically subversion of Terminator
since AI and watever
Will Chen: well okay so if they first picked like
a single ai to like upload into a robot
who would that person be
Frank Lin: yea
i'm stuck on that
Will Chen: but the question here is like
you want them to become kind of cynical afterwards
but that might not exactly be the same as the initial subject
Frank Lin: oh true
Will Chen: they would've chosen for this experiment
Frank Lin: maybe someone who believed 
Will Chen: which is why it makes this kind of harder
Frank Lin: in the robot uprising
Will Chen: okay first of all
Frank Lin: and then someone up and puts him
into a robot body
Will Chen: who pickes the robot
Frank Lin: so there's one other guy
who's an actual human
still at the 'resort'
Will Chen: okay let me put it this way
if I was like in charge of a bunch of ai's
and I made a robot that could input ai into it
the last fucking person I would put into it
would be someone who wants to start a robot uprising
Frank Lin: oh
i meant someone who believed one day robots would rise up
kind of like poetic justice
Will Chen: or I mean another reasonable explaination would be that
the person in the robot
is someone the person actually knew?
wait no
too long ago
Frank Lin: yea
Will Chen: in time for that to hapen
but robot uprisings
is a thing for like modern day issues
Frank Lin: wat if
Will Chen: in which the world was filled with robotic ai
Frank Lin: it was a completely new consciousness
Will Chen: the idea of a robot uprising wouldn't exist in your world
Frank Lin: forexample
it was an AI that was made from the collective consciousness of multiple memories?
also
you have to remember
each Core is specialized
u can safely assume this is the only core
that has perfected AI
Will Chen: I meant for the human
like why would a human
believe that the robot uprising is a good idea
Frank Lin: well
that's why i said
Will Chen: its literally a single core facility
Frank Lin: it could be just an amalgamation
so it's not a single person
but more like a chimera
or smthing
Will Chen: are we talking about the robot or the human in charge of makign the robot
Frank Lin: something that thinks like a human but is selfaware it isn't
the robot
Will Chen: okay so my question here is about the human
Frank Lin: ohhh
like why is there only one person
Will Chen: they get to pick who to put into the robot right?
and why would they put
whatever thing into it
like 
Frank Lin: no the robot
is older
than the human
it's been in the facility longer than the man has
Will Chen: so when was the robot made
Frank Lin: well considering it's a prototype
definitely before the facility was turned into a resort
Will Chen: well so it should be near like
when the cores were built
Frank Lin: yea
Will Chen: around the time of the apocalypse
Frank Lin: you can safely assume so
considering it's experimental
Will Chen: so then the person they picked should've been someone they trusted
to maintain the facility
Frank Lin: u could say
it was the original founder
Will Chen: and with the skills and knowledge to
Frank Lin: actually
so it should be
someone who the founder knew
Will Chen: maybe one of the top engineers
or something
Frank Lin: but maybe
instead of direct immortality by transferring consciousness into a new body
wat about the idea of a completely new ai born from semantic constructs stitched together
like creating a new "identity"
Will Chen: but this is something you would test first not in like
a robot
you would first create it in a virtual space
Frank Lin: he could be the result of that virtual space test
Will Chen: because what if it was violent
Frank Lin: for example it worked in the computer simulation
so he's the result of phase 2
Will Chen: I mean I guess
Frank Lin: plus since the facility still stands
Will Chen: that could work
Frank Lin: obviously he's not violent
Will Chen: well I'm saying the choice
Frank Lin: considering how the singularity just passed without issue
Will Chen: to move the ai into the robot
has to be like a smart decision making
not like oh boy this ai is so violent
Frank Lin: i mean it's not that bad of a choice
Will Chen: let us just put it into the robot
and see what actually ahppens
okay well I know that said
Frank Lin: robots were always meant
Will Chen: ai isn't violent
Frank Lin: to take over physical tasks
Will Chen: but I'm just saying that the scientists should be smart enough
Frank Lin: bruh scientists aren't smart in terms of ethics
Will Chen: not to intentionally end up creating a singularity
that easily
Frank Lin: everyone wants to intentionally create a singularity actually
Will Chen: its more of a safety hazzard more than like
ethics
Frank Lin: that's one of the common goals of modern scientists lmao
Will Chen: but then again if you do want to compare it to frankenstein
Frank Lin: that's why those big names banding together talking about the ethics of robotics exists
Will Chen: he was pretty stupid
made a living person
didn't even think of containing them
Frank Lin: basically will scientists don't care about ethics period
Will Chen: his creation just walks out the front door
Frank Lin: u should see viks and his ethics class
his ethics are literally
i make my own ethics
and he got an A for that
Will Chen: ...
Frank Lin: lmaoooo
Will Chen: humans are doomed
Frank Lin: basically when you're doing this kind of shit
no one gives a fuck
that's why coalitions exist
Will Chen: god have you heard about the whatever face ai tracker like ceo dude
that guy's a psychopath
Frank Lin: so your argument hinging on scientists having ethics is kinda a moot point
uhhh
face ai tracker dude?
like satellite app tracking?
with facetime or smthing
Will Chen: okay don't remember the actual name of the company
Frank Lin: could be niantic
Will Chen: but I'll find it later
Frank Lin: people were pretty terrified of that whole pokemon go thing
having data sent to the NSA
Will Chen: but basically people who startup potentially ethically compromising businesses
for money
are generally not good people
Frank Lin: that's like
99% of everyone
who start a company
Will Chen: okay I need to go eat dinner now
but later 
Frank Lin: oof
later come back
Will Chen: I'll go find the info for this
Frank Lin: and tell me more
yes
this is good
research
also
do u think
maybe the setting
would lend itself to a more serious atmosphere better
tbh i don't find it super fun to generally write that way
this was a lot more interesting imo
